Here's a breakdown of the fitness application project requirements:

**Core Functions**

- **Fitness Content:** The app provides fitness routines either by pulling trusted content from online sources or having routines pre-loaded.
- **Live Training:** Users can join real-time workout sessions led by either group trainers or book individual trainers.
- **Trainer Appointments:** A calendar feature for users to schedule one-on-one sessions with personal trainers, ensuring the calendar sync is functional for smooth booking.

**Organization-Specific "Walks" Feature**

- **Email Restriction:** Access to this feature is limited to users with a "wlv.ac.uk" email address. This suggests it's designed for a university or company setting.
- **Walk Proposals:** Users can design routes on a map, set times, and starting points. Others can view and express interest in joining.
- **Walk Participation:** Users sign up to join proposed walks.
- **Walk Media:** Users can take and share photos/videos specifically tied to walks they've participated in for later viewing.

**Additional Considerations**

- **Further Features:** The project is open to expanding features, so more things could get added as development progresses.
